When you need to write something in a manner that could be understood by a machine, though, simply injecting the text is often not enough. Many times, you need to convert the message into binary code. Sometimes, this can also make a good stylistic change to utterly transform the look and style of the text you are working with.",

Such a tool can be the simplest, easiest way for you to change things up and keep the binary code available for usage whenever you might happen to need it.",
        text: "The challenge you might have when it comes to binary code is learning how to translate ASCII text into binary. This can be a huge undertaking, and it could take you several hours just to translate a few short paragraphs. Instead of wasting your valuable time like this, why not speed up the process and instead use our binary code translator?",
        textdata: "This simple to use translation tool can speed up the entire experience. Translation of something as important as binary code is very easy to make mistakes with, too, which can lead to all manner of problems â€“ least of all changes to the message you intend to put across.",
        data: "If you want to avoid that kind of problem, all you need to do is download our translation tool and try it out for yourself. Quickly, you will see the immense value that stems from using binary code either in coding or in some form of artistic design choice intended."

You can then copy and paste this code wherever you want. You will see that when you paste it back on the right hand side column that it also gets converted back into English. You can do this back and forth if you wish.",
