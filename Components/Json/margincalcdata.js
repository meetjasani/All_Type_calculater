        title: "Is Buying on Margin a Good Idea?",
        sentence: "Buying on margin means taking out a loan from a brokerage company for paying it as the investment. Like any other loan, the interest is to be paid against the amount you're borrowing. It is one of the ways for buying stocks, but the question is whether it's a good or bad decision to buy on margin. Buying on margin can double the profits, but it involves a lot of risks because the chance of doubling the losses also exists. Even if the stock stays neutral, your position won't be at breakeven because you'll have to pay the interest against the loan you have borrowed. Buying on margin is a good idea for the people who won't be affected by the risks involved in it. It's not recommended for first-time investors."
