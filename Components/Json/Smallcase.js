        sentence: "What the tiny text generator essentially does is transform your normal text into a set of subscript characters as well as small caps. It looks small as it is using what’s known as a unicode alphabet. The small text generator basically allows you the capability of copying and pasting it into status updates on Facebook, Instagram & Twitter as well as Excel, Word and other documents. If the text were actually converted into tiny font - unfortunately, you wouldn’t be able to do that.",
